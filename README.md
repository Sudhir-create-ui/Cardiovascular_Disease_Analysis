# Cardiovascular_Disease_Analysis
# Cardiovascular Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

This project demonstrates data analysis on a **cardiovascular health dataset** using **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI**.  

## Project Overview
- **Dataset:** 15-column cardiovascular dataset including patient info, vital stats, and target (heart disease presence).  
- **Objective:** Analyze risk factors, visualize insights, and create an interactive dashboard for heart disease prediction.  

## Features
- Load CSV data into PostgreSQL and perform basic to advanced SQL queries.
- Calculate metrics like average age, cholesterol, resting BP, and target distribution.
- Identify high-risk patients based on multiple risk factors.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard:
  - Age and gender demographics
  - Target distribution (disease vs no disease)
  - Cholesterol & BP analysis
  - Age group vs disease correlation
  - Risk stratification visualizations

## Folder Structure
- `data/` → Contains raw CSV dataset  
- `sql/` → PostgreSQL table creation and query scripts  
- `powerbi/` → Power BI dashboard file
